# Game

[![Ruby Code Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/standardrb/standard)

I'm building a game that will help kids build numerical automaticity.

## Tapioca & Sorbet

We love Sorbet so we use it in this repo.

### Helpful commands and references

Regenerate active record rbi files; You'll need to do this as you create new rails models.

```bash
# https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca?tab=readme-ov-file#generating-rbi-files-for-rails-and-other-dsls
$ bin/tapioca dsl

# https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca?tab=readme-ov-file#pulling-rbi-annotations-from-remote-sources
$ bin/tapioca gems

# https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca?tab=readme-ov-file#pulling-rbi-annotations-from-remote-sources
$ bin/tapioca annotations
```

[Tapioca](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca) - "The swiss army knife of RBI generation."

[Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) - "Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby."

## Database setup

Regenerate the seed database. Warning, this will delete existing records.

```bash
$ rails db:seed
```

## Tests

Run

```bash
$ rails test
```

## Start the server

Run

```bash
$ bin/dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tailwind

If Tailwind is only partially working, it is likely because some Tailwind classes you are trying to apply have been purged. Run `rails assets:clobber` and make sure you are running `bin/dev` and not `rails s`.

### Fly.io

Right now we use 256mb of memory machines because ðŸ’°. Rails console requires more than this amoutn of memory. To scale the memory of the machine, run `fly scale memory 512`. Then to open rails console run: `fly ssh console --pty -C "/rails/bin/rails console"`

## Squashed Bugs and Errors

We added a `person_id` foreign key to the `Responses` table. Since `person_id` could not be null and there were existing `response` records in the DB, the deploy failed because the migration failed. The migration failed because of the existing `response` records not having an associated person. To fix, we opened production rails console and ran `Response.destroy_all`. In the future, either make the null constraint `false` or pre-emptively delete existing records that violate the constraint.

Deploy

```bash
fly deploy
```

## Next Steps

- P0 Code review and clean up
- P0 CDN
- P1 Change team name
- P1 Email campaigns
- P2 Admin should be able to see orders
- P2 Admin should be able to see players
- investigate https://loops.so/pricing

- Admin -> players -> player 500s, rethink how we set current_player
- no bad words for player names
- Timzone edit more obvious
- Turn sound off option
- Delete account
- Pagevies - Consider Data Retention Policies: Implement policies for how long you'll retain this data, and consider periodic cleanup routines.
- Pagination for admin/requests
